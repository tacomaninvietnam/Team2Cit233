                <p>
                    Glen Arbor touts itself as America's most beautiful place, though this can be debated.  The scenery is quite nice though.  Sitting upon the Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore and the Sleeping Bear Dunes, Glen arbor is full of outdoor adventure.
                    The businesses in the area cater almost entirely to tourists and their needs, providing them with places to rent bicycles and kyaks and also helping to organize a slew of local fesivals all summer long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nestled inside the national park, Glen Arbor provides a nice hub to get supplies or a meal when you are done exploring.  The town is host to a wide variety of restaurants, bars, and even ice cream shops to slake your thirst in the summer heat.
                    The Boonedocks provides for an entertainment rich atmosphere for the whole family with a giant outdoor deck, candy store, and live bands.  Just don't order the world famous onion rings, the cooks are swamped enough as it is.

                    Lifestyle[edit]

                    Glen Arbor is a popular tourist area for a few months during the summer when the local merchants and year-round inhabitants watch the population nearly triple. Residents of Detroit, Chicago, and many other parts of the Midwest travel to Northern Michigan to enjoy the warm weather and scenic beaches. Glen Arbor is situated on a small strip of land directly between Glen Lake and Lake Michigan which allows visitors to choose from two different bodies of water from which to waterski, fish, or sunbathe. The community sits in the middle of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, a federally protected park.

                    During the winter months, year-round inhabitants remain in the area to take advantage of outdoor winter sports. Both downhill skiing and cross-country skiing are popular pastimes along with hiking and hunting.
